							<h2>ABOUT</h2>
							<p>Balloon is a game in which you are a balloon and try to push yourself as high as you can.
								<br>Won 1st place at University of Michigan Wolverine Soft 2019 48-hours Turkey Game Jam.
								<br>Developed by 6 University of Michigan students.</p>
							<h2>DEVELOPMENT INFO</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Developed by Lapforce Interactive.
								</li>
								<li>
									48-hours development cycle (2019 Fall, Umich 49-hours Pumpkin Game Jam)
								</li>
								<li>
									6 developers
								</li>
								<li>
									Made using Unity Engine
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>CONTRIBUTIONS</h2>

							<h2>WHAT WENT RIGHT</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Efficient team conversation. After we knew the topic of the game jam, 
									we quickly discussed and decided the game mechanic, complete game loop and art style,
									and made sure everyone is on the boat.
								</li>
								<li>
									Clean work/takss division. We have three team members worked on environment art(birds, cloud, trap, ...), 
									one worked on player control/movement, one worked on traps interaction , 
									and final one work on random procedural level generator. 
									Basically no overlap or task dependence between team members.
								</li>
								<li>
									Lots of environment art prefabs and trap prefab are easy to reuse, allowing us to made just several 
									prefabs and reuse, recombine them everywhere to create abundant levels.
								</li>
								<li>
									The above three points made our workflow super efficient, 
									everyone can work 100% parallel until the final step: combining everything together. 
									We end up finishing most of the game within 6 hours. For the rest time of the game jam, 
									we basically just chill, have enough sleep and do some polish here and there.
								</li>

							</ul>

							<h2>WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Git has some compatibality issue with Unity, especially when it comes to art work(sprites, animation,...) 
									and require some tweaking first(ex: .gitignore or else) before convenient usage.
									However, we forgot to align every team member's tweaking between Git and Unity at the begining, so 
									the updates in some of the art work were once reverted in the middle of the development or report some weird merge comflict. 
								</li>
								<li>
									More elements(traps, interactives, pcikups, ...) can be added to make the game more thrilling and abundant.
								</li>
							</ul>

							
							<h2>LESSONS LEARNED</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Task/work division must be done with care. Good and clean work/takss division(no overlap or task dependence between team members) 
									can allow 100% parallel working and fast development speed.
								</li>
								<li>
									In game jam, simple game mechanic and game loop are likely to be completed with decent polish. 
									So nail down the game mechanic, game loop, and art style quick and communicate them thoroughly to every team member.

							<p>
								<span class="image left" ><img src="../images/Balloon/balloon_lg1.png" alt=""></span>
								My major contribution to this project was the design amd implementaiton of the random procedural level generator. 
								In this game, there is no boundary or transparent wall that block  players. 
								Player as a ballon can go toward any direction as far as they want.
								However, have a really really large world for player to fly around is very resource consuming and also require 
								lots of effort in level design.
								<span class="image right"><img src="../images/Balloon/balloon_lg2.png" alt=""></span>
								<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
								To solve this issue, I designed and implemented a random procedural level generator(level manager). 
								First, I used block as an unit of the world, and then I made several block prefabs with different environment layout.
								Then, at the begining of the game, the world starts small with only several blocks surrounding the player. 
								When the player start flying around, for example, if player flies towawrd left and about to reach the boundary, 
								the generator will randomly pick a block prefab to expand the world to the left, and also will delete the 
								blocks that are too far away from the player to avoid resources waste.

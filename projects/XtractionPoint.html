							<h2>ABOUT</h2>
							<p>Xtraction Point is a 2D game in which two players have to collaborate together to fight against enemies

							<h2>WHAT WENT RIGHT</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									A single player ability : shield can invoke abundant and various gameplay mechanic 
									and puzzles revolving around it. 
								</li>
								<li>
									Combination of collaborative puzzles and combats make the game intense and thrilling.
								</li>
								<li>
									Playtesting & Iteration early and often helps improving the gameplay experience a lot.
								</li>
								<li>
									Well designed turret system and interface allowing quick development of different kinds of turret variants. 
									Even the development of the final boss take advantage of this.
								</li>
								<li>
									Clean task design and division which avoid task-dependency between members allowing efficient ~100% parallel working.
								</li>

							</ul>

							<h2>WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									VFX of players' ability.
								</li>
								<li>
									The original arrangement was expected to be that one member designed the tricks(enemies,
									bullets and traps), and the other one design levels and applied those prefabs in it. However, 
									because of a lack of frequent communication, the member in charge of level design didnâ€™t
									know how to use the prefabs created by another teammate, postponing the playtest of new levels.
								</li>
								<li>
									Communication between technical mambers and art members were not done effective enough. 
									This caused the mechanic of some game objects implemented by technical members does not match 
									art members' work(ex: boss movement), and one side end up having to redo their work.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>LESSONS LEARNED</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Things like level design still needs to be done by more than one person. As
									the imagination and ideas of one person can be limited, it is impossible for only one person to
									handle all the level design.
								</li>
								<li>
									Communication should be more frequent and effective.

							<h1 class="major">CONTRIBUTIONS</h1>
							<p>
								Since this game is  developed by a small team of 4 people, everyone worked on extensive types of stuff. 
								For me, I worked on the game mechanic design, player controller, player's shield VFX, lots of level design and implementation, 
								boss behaviour system design and implementation, boss level design and implementation, laser VFX.
								<br><br>
								<span class="image left" style="max-width:60%;"><img src="../images/XtractionPoint/XP-level1.gif" alt=""></span>
								My initial proposal is to build a 4-player top down tactical shooter game where players are special forces using 
								different gadgets to coolaborate to breach/sneak into enemy spaceship, and player's movement should be less 
								dynamic. One scenario is that while one player was solving puzzle to open a door, 
								other players have to cover that player from surrounding enemies. Another scenario is that when players try to push through 
								a corridor with tons of enemies, one player has to wield shield as cover for other players while other players shooting back 
								at enemies, like a SWAT team. However, after discussion, we thought that the theme of special forces may limit how 
								wild the level tricks can go. Also, it seems like only me like special forces, other team members especially the artist 
								want something more fantasy.(To be honest, I believed this is the real reason, but anyway, dont make artist unhappy, 
								especially when your team only has one.)
								<br><br>
								<span class="image right" style="max-width:60%;"><img src="../images/XtractionPoint/XP-level2.gif" alt=""></span>
								The concept of our level design revolves around two things, collaboration and players' shield. 
								Starting from this concept, many idea poped up very quickly, like players cover each other's back 
								while waling through a corridor with lines of turrets on both side, or using shield to bounce bullets 
								to open doors.
								<br><br>
								While I was designing the boss level, one thing worth thinking about was how should player damage the boss. 
								Since players only have shield, stun ability and a long-cooldown damage ability, 
								we need extra damage source for players to utilize. TO solve this, I was largely inspired by <b><i>Metal Slug</i></b>. 
								<b><i>Metal Slug</i></b> has lots of epic boss fight design, in one of them, 
								the level provide a fixed machine gun for players' usage, and this is what our boss level design make use of.

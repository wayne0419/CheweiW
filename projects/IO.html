							<h2>ABOUT</h2>
							<p>Io is a single-player 2D action platformer game featuring challenging combat, difficult platforming and a final boss. 
								Player has to fight their way down to the bottom of the dark abyss to discover the source of the problem that is plaguing the village.
								<br>A long term project completed over a semester by around 90 University of Michigan students.</p>
							<h2>DEVELOPMENT INFO</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Developed by WolverineSoft Studio
								</li>
								<li>
									3 month development cycle (02/04/2020 - 5/04/2020)
								</li>
								<li>
									90 developers
								</li>
								<li>
									Made using Unity Engine
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>WHAT WENT RIGHT</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Boss behaviour system created, allowing for designers to design and implement boss behaviours without having to directly
									code or work extensively alongside programmers.
								</li>
								<li>
									Developer tools creating using ScriptableObjects and Gizmos allowed for designers to design and implement attacks without having to directly
									code or work extensively alongside programmers
								</li>
								<li>
									Division of boss implementation into State Machine, Attack, and Projectiles allowed for a modular system that allowed fast prototpying and 
									creation, and the system was stable enough that it is being considered for future WolverineSoft Studio Projects
								</li>
								<li>
									Usage of Confluence Collaboration Software allowed for designers, artists, and audio engineers to easily look up documentation for assets 
									created by programmers, and prototype using them without the direction of a programmer
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Because progress was far slower than initially anticipated, severe downscoping was required, with only 2 levels left of 
									the original 6, and 1 boss instead of 2
								</li>
								<li>
									Sprint deadlines were often not meant, with tasks being worked on days after they where due, and many tasks were pushed to 
									the backlog and future sprints, causing work to pile up
								</li>
								<li>
									Playtesting, while extensive, was not done enough, resulting in game-breaking bugs in implementation being discovered very 
									late into prodcution, forcing programmers to work overtime to fix them
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>LESSONS LEARNED</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Task assignment must be done with far more care, taking into consideration any unexpected circumstances that may cause them to take
									 far more time, and sprint deadlines must be enforced more strictly to avoid work piling up
								</li>
								<li>
									Extensive playtesting must be done for not only features and design, but also for any custom tools that were created for the projcet
								</li>
								<li>
									While downscoping happens during the development process of almost every game, it should be taken in consideration during preproduction 
									to prevent very large segments being removed after work has already been done

								My major contribution to this project was the design amd implementaiton of the Boss Behaviour System. 
								The system not only has a finite state machine that controls the states(attack, idle, hurt,...) of the boss 
								and allows other developers to add callback functions, but it also has a phase system that
								allow designers to easily implement bosses' phase transition(ex: normal -> angry -> furious), and 
								attack abilities patterm through a customized Unity Inspector and Scene Editor without touching code. 
								The boss system was initially divided into 3 parts, 
								the Behaviour System, which controlled the behavior of the boss, the BossAttackScriptableObject, which stored the 
								properties of the attack, such as the animations, and coordinates for the projectiles, and the Projectile prefab, 
								which was the individual projectiles that would be instantiated by the BossAttackScriptableObject, which was in 
								turn called on by the Behaviour System.  
								<span class="image right"><img src="../images/IO/IO_BSM2.png" alt=""></span>
								<br><br><br><br><br>
								The design and implementation of the Boss Behaviour System at the early stage of the development
								only included the finite state machine. However, as the bosses' design progressed, the design team wanted 
								bosses to have multiple phases(ex: normal -> angry -> furious), and when a boss get hurt to a certain threshold, 
								it will enter into next phase with a more aggressive, outrageous attack patterm.
								This means the system was no longer enough to meet design team's need. 
								After some discussion, I restructure the behaviour system so that the boss behaviour system becomes 
								a combination of finite state machine and phase editor, allowing designers to easily implement or adjust a boss' behaviour.
								Also, when implementing boss' attack abilities, there are some attack abilities that are tricky 
								to be implemented using BossAttackScriptableObject, so later on I adjust the behavior system to 
								also support attack abilities that are implemented as a function.
